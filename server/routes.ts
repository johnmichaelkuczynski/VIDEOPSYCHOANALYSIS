DO NOT claim you cannot see clothing, hair, or other obvious visual details. DO NOT say "visual data does not contain sufficient detail" when details are clearly visible.

MANDATORY VISUAL OBSERVATIONS - Describe what you actually see:

1. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE: State the person's visible gender, estimated age, and physical features you can observe
2. CLOTHING & ATTIRE: CRITICAL - Describe the exact clothing visible with precise color accuracy. Look carefully at shirt colors (white, light blue, dark, etc.), types of garments (shirt, jacket, etc.), style, fit. Double-check color descriptions for accuracy.
3. HAIR STYLE & GROOMING: Detail the hair style, color, length, and grooming state you can see
4. PHYSICAL BUILD & BODY TYPE: Describe the person's visible physical structure and build
5. BODY POSTURE & POSITIONING: Detail their posture, position, and stance as shown
6. BODY LANGUAGE: Describe visible gestures, expressions, and body positioning
7. SETTING & ENVIRONMENT: Detail the background, location, and surroundings visible
8. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT: Note lighting, atmosphere, and spatial context shown

- Hypofrontality signals (vacant passivity, disengagement)

I. SEXUAL/BEHAVIORAL PATHOLOGY INDICATORS:
- Exhibitionistic signals (gaze + posture implying compulsion to expose)
- Incongruent eroticism (smile or look detached from social cues)
- Hypersexual restlessness (subtle agitation, mouth tension)
- Voyeuristic detachment (watching without emotional reciprocity)
- Compulsive self-directed expression (facial/self-soothing consistent with masturbation compulsion)

J. GLOBAL INTEGRATION & BREAKDOWN:
- Affect-cognition mismatch (face doesn't match thought content)
- Fragmentation (facial/body cues pointing in different directions)
- Defensive rigidity (every cue locked in one controlled position)
- Dissociation indicators (blankness, spacing-out, absent gaze)
- Psychotic flattening (total deadness of expression despite stimulation)

FORBIDDEN PHRASES - DO NOT USE:
- "visual data does not contain sufficient detail"
- "cannot be accurately assessed"
- "information not available"
- "comprehensive analysis cannot be conducted"

VISUAL DATA:
${faceAnalysis ? JSON.stringify(faceAnalysis, null, 2) : 'No faces detected in this image'}

REQUIRED ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

- Are there microexpressions inconsistent with conscious behavior?
- Evidence of repression, affect splitting, or emotional masking?

2. DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE
- Signs of denial, projection, dissociation, or intellectualization?
- Are facial gestures exaggerated or oddly suppressed?
- Subtle discomfort indicators (tension, asymmetry, positioning)?
- Dominant defense mechanisms and ego structure?

3. AGENCY & INTENTIONALITY
- Does the person appear to initiate or react in this moment?
- Is gaze active (direct, confronting), passive (drifting), or avoidant (deflecting)?
- Do they anticipate being watched or is behavior unguarded?
- Evidence of narcissistic control, performativity, or authenticity?

4. ATTACHMENT SIGNALS
- Are expressions relational (inviting, challenging, appeasing)?

- Do they orient toward or away from implied viewer?
- Attachment style indicators (secure, avoidant, ambivalent, disorganized)?

5. COGNITIVE PROCESSING STYLE
- Does facial expression indicate fast, slow, or effortful thinking?
- Micro-expressions reflecting insight, confusion, deflection, or compulsivity?

- Hyperaware of camera/presentation (exhibitionism)?
- Expectation of attention or validation?
- Closed system (self-sufficient) or open system (socially responsive)?

2. CLOTHING & ATTIRE: CRITICAL - Describe the exact clothing visible with precise color accuracy. Look carefully at shirt colors (white, light blue, dark, etc.), types, style, accessories (shirts, headphones, etc.). Double-check color descriptions for accuracy.
3. HAIR STYLE & GROOMING: Detail the hair style, color, length, and grooming state shown
4. PHYSICAL BUILD & BODY TYPE: Describe the person's visible physical structure and build
5. BODY POSTURE & POSITIONING: Detail their posture, position, and stance in the video
6. BODY LANGUAGE: Describe visible gestures, expressions, and body positioning
7. SETTING & ENVIRONMENT: Detail the background, location, and surroundings shown
8. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT: Note lighting, atmosphere, and spatial context visible

CLINICAL VISUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL MARKERS TO ASSESS:

A. AFFECT & EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION:
- Blunted affect (flat, minimal emotional display)
- Inappropriate affect (smiling/laughing when incongruent)
- Labile affect (rapid, unstable mood shifts)
- Affective incongruity (expression doesn't match context)
- Affective detachment (vacant, absent gaze)

B. GAZE & EYES:
- Vacant stare (psychotic detachment)
- Predatory stare (fixated, unblinking)
- Rapid darting eyes (paranoia, hypervigilance)
- Avoidant gaze (withdrawal, shame, social fear)
- Odd eye movements (neurological or psychotic marker)

C. FACIAL EXPRESSION & MICRO-EXPRESSION:
- Micro-expression leakage (fleeting flashes of hidden emotion)
- Incongruent smile (tense or inappropriate)
- Asymmetrical facial activation (neurological/psychotic)
- Expression rigidity (frozen, mask-like face)
- Sudden twitching/tics (psychomotor agitation)

D. SPEECH/MOUTH INDICATORS:
- Tight lips (suppression)
- Slack mouth (cognitive deficit, negative symptoms)
- Overt smirk/contempt display
- Muttering/subvocalization (lip movement without speech)
- Chewing or jaw tension (impulse containment, anxiety)

E. POSTURE & PSYCHOMOTOR SIGNS:
- Catatonic stillness
- Excessive motor inhibition (frozen pose, rigidity)
- Psychomotor agitation (restless shifting, jerky movement)
- Odd body angles/postures (schizophrenia sign)
- Tremors or fine shaking

F. ATTACHMENT/RELATIONAL CUES:
- Dismissive-avoidant presentation (aloof, emotionally cut off)
- Fearful-avoidant (mixed approach-avoidance cues)
- Dependent/submissive signaling
- Hostile/defiant signaling
- Total relational absence (flat, non-engaged presence)

G. DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS:
- Projection (anger or suspicion outwardly implied)
- Paranoid vigilance (readiness for threat)
- Isolation of affect (emotion sealed off from thought)
- Intellectualization (blank, analytic detachment)
- Denial/disavowal (incongruence between look and situation)

H. COGNITIVE/NEUROLOGICAL STYLE:
- Thought blocking (sudden mental emptiness visible in face)
- Disorganized affect integration (chaotic shifts in facial/body cues)
- Perseverative fixation (locked stare, repetitive micro-behavior)
- Delusional intensity (eyes/gaze suggesting conviction detached from reality)
- Hypofrontality signals (vacant passivity, disengagement)

I. SEXUAL/BEHAVIORAL PATHOLOGY INDICATORS:
- Exhibitionistic signals (gaze + posture implying compulsion to expose)
- Incongruent eroticism (smile or look detached from social cues)
- Hypersexual restlessness (subtle agitation, mouth tension)
- Voyeuristic detachment (watching without emotional reciprocity)
- Compulsive self-directed expression (facial/self-soothing consistent with masturbation compulsion)

J. GLOBAL INTEGRATION & BREAKDOWN:
- Affect-cognition mismatch (face doesn't match thought content)
- Fragmentation (facial/body cues pointing in different directions)
- Defensive rigidity (every cue locked in one controlled position)
- Dissociation indicators (blankness, spacing-out, absent gaze)
- Psychotic flattening (total deadness of expression despite stimulation)
