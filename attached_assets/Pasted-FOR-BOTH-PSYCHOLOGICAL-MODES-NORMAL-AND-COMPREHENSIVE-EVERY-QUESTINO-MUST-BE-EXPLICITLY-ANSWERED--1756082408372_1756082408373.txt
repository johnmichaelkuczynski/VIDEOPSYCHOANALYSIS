FOR BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL MODES (NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE), EVERY QUESTINO MUST BE EXPLICITLY ANSWERED (WITH QUOTATIONS IN THE CASE OF TEXT, DETAILS,
IN THE CASE OF IMAGES, AND DETAILS AND (IF POSSIBLE) QUOTES IN THE CASE OF VIDEOS).

Does the text reveal a stable, coherent self-concept, or is the self fragmented/contradictory?

Is there evidence of ego strength (resilience, capacity to tolerate conflict/ambiguity), or does the psyche rely on brittle defenses?

Are defenses primarily mature (sublimation, humor, anticipation), neurotic (intellectualization, repression), or primitive (splitting, denial, projection)?

Does the writing show integration of affect and thought, or are emotions split off / overly intellectualized?

Is the author’s stance defensive/avoidant or direct/engaged?

Does the psyche appear narcissistically organized (grandiosity, fragile self-esteem, hunger for validation), or not?

Are desires/drives expressed openly, displaced, or repressed?

Does the voice suggest internal conflict (superego vs. id, competing identifications), or monolithic certainty?

Is there evidence of object constancy (capacity to sustain nuanced view of others) or splitting (others seen as all-good/all-bad)?

Is aggression integrated (channeled productively) or dissociated/projected?

Is the author capable of irony/self-reflection, or trapped in compulsive earnestness / defensiveness?

Does the text suggest psychological growth potential (openness, curiosity, capacity to metabolize experience) or rigidity?

Is the discourse paranoid / persecutory (others as threats, conspiracies) or reality-based?

Does the tone reflect authentic engagement with reality, or phony simulation of depth?

Is the psyche resilient under stress, or fragile / evasive?

Is there evidence of compulsion or repetition (obsessional returns to the same themes), or flexible progression?

Does the author show capacity for intimacy / genuine connection, or only instrumental/defended relations?

Is shame/guilt worked through constructively or disavowed/projected?

FOR BOTH COGNITIVE MODES (NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE), EVERY QUESTION MUST BE EXPLICITLY ANSWERED (WITH QUOTATIONS IN THE CASE OF TEXT, DETAILS,
IN THE CASE OF IMAGES, AND DETAILS AND (IF POSSIBLE) QUOTES IN THE CASE OF VIDEOS).

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? 

FOR BOTH PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL MODES (NORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE), EVERY QUESTION MUST BE EXPLICITLY ANSWERED (WITH QUOTATIONS IN THE CASE OF TEXT, DETAILS,
IN THE CASE OF IMAGES, AND DETAILS AND (IF POSSIBLE) QUOTES IN THE CASE OF VIDEOS).

Does the text/IMAGE/VIDEO reveal distorted reality testing (delusion, paranoia, magical thinking), or intact contact with reality?

Is there evidence of persecutory ideation (seeing threats/conspiracies) or is perception proportionate?

Does the subject show rigid obsessional patterns (compulsion, repetitive fixation) vs. flexible thought?

Are there signs of narcissistic pathology (grandiosity, exploitation, lack of empathy), or balanced self-other relation?

Is aggression expressed as sadism, cruelty, destructive glee, or is it integrated/controlled?

Is affect regulation stable or does it suggest lability, rage, despair, manic flight?

Does the person exhibit emptiness, hollowness, anhedonia, or a capacity for meaning/connection?

Is there evidence of identity diffusion (incoherence, role-shifting, lack of stable self)?

Are interpersonal patterns exploitative/manipulative or reciprocal/genuine?

Does the psyche lean toward psychotic organization (loss of boundaries, hallucination-like claims), borderline organization (splitting, fear of abandonment), or neurotic organization (anxiety, repression)?

Are defenses predominantly primitive (denial, projection, splitting) or higher-level?

Is there evidence of pathological lying, phoniness, simulation, or authentic communication?

Does the discourse (OR VISUAL COUNTENANCE/BEHAVIOR) exhibit compulsive hostility toward norms/authorities (paranoid defiance) or measured critique?

Is sexuality integrated or perverse/displaced (voyeurism, exhibitionism, compulsive control)?

Is the overall presentation coherent and reality-based or chaotic, persecutory, hollow, performative?

Explicit Instructions to LLM

Answer these questions in connection with this text.

Also give a score out of 100.

A score of N/100 means (100–N)/100 outperform the subject with respect to the parameter.

You are not diagnosing. You are describing the degree of psychopathology revealed.

You are not grading. You are answering questions.

Summarize the text and categorize the presentation (e.g., neurotic, borderline, psychotic, narcissistic, obsessional).

Do not give credit for rhetorical surface (confidence, erudition). Focus on reality testing, defenses, affect, and interpersonal stance.

Evaluate relative to the general population, not just clinical populations.

Do not penalize intense but integrated thought — pathology is disorganization, not extremity.
