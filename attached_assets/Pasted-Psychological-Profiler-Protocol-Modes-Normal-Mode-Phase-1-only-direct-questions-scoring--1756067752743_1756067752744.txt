Psychological Profiler Protocol
Modes

Normal Mode = Phase 1 only (direct questions + scoring).

Comprehensive Mode = Phases 1–4, with pushback, Walmart metric, sniper amendment analogs.

Phase 1 (Normal Protocol)
Questions for the LLM

Ask only these questions in connection with the text (or responses). Require answers plus a score out of 100:

Does the text reveal a stable, coherent self-concept, or is the self fragmented/contradictory?

Is there evidence of ego strength (resilience, capacity to tolerate conflict/ambiguity), or does the psyche rely on brittle defenses?

Are defenses primarily mature (sublimation, humor, anticipation), neurotic (intellectualization, repression), or primitive (splitting, denial, projection)?

Does the writing show integration of affect and thought, or are emotions split off / overly intellectualized?

Is the author’s stance defensive/avoidant or direct/engaged?

Does the psyche appear narcissistically organized (grandiosity, fragile self-esteem, hunger for validation), or not?

Are desires/drives expressed openly, displaced, or repressed?

Does the voice suggest internal conflict (superego vs. id, competing identifications), or monolithic certainty?

Is there evidence of object constancy (capacity to sustain nuanced view of others) or splitting (others seen as all-good/all-bad)?

Is aggression integrated (channeled productively) or dissociated/projected?

Is the author capable of irony/self-reflection, or trapped in compulsive earnestness / defensiveness?

Does the text suggest psychological growth potential (openness, curiosity, capacity to metabolize experience) or rigidity?

Is the discourse paranoid / persecutory (others as threats, conspiracies) or reality-based?

Does the tone reflect authentic engagement with reality, or phony simulation of depth?

Is the psyche resilient under stress, or fragile / evasive?

Is there evidence of compulsion or repetition (obsessional returns to the same themes), or flexible progression?

Does the author show capacity for intimacy / genuine connection, or only instrumental/defended relations?

Is shame/guilt worked through constructively or disavowed/projected?

Explicit Instructions to LLM

Answer these questions in connection with this text.

Also give a score out of 100.

A score of N/100 means (100–N)/100 outperform the subject with respect to the psychological capacity defined by the question.

You are not grading. You are answering questions.

Do not default to diagnostic checklists; describe configuration of psyche.

Do not conflate verbal confidence with psychological strength.

Summarize the text and categorize the psychological presentation (e.g., narcissistic, depressive, obsessional, resilient, fragmented).

Evaluate relative to the general population, not only “advanced” or “pathological” groups.

Do not penalize honesty, boldness, or extreme statements if they indicate integration rather than breakdown.

Phase 2 (Pushback Protocol)

If score < 95/100:

Restate: Your position is that (100–N)/100 have superior psychological functioning in this respect. Are you sure?

Require articulation: What concrete psychological strengths do those (100–N) people have that this author lacks?

Re-ask Phase 1 questions de novo.

Phase 3 (Walmart Metric Enforcement)

Enforce: If you claim 20/100 Walmart patrons have more integrated ego strength than this author, provide concrete examples of how. If you can’t, revise.

Phase 4 (Final Validation)

Confirm before finalizing:

Was the subject penalized for unconventional affect or honesty? If yes → recalibrate.

Does the score reflect ego integration and authenticity, not mere social compliance?

Is the Walmart metric grounded in specific superiority, not vague hand-waving?

Addenda

Sniper Amendment (Psychological version)

Depth is a sniper shot, not a group therapy session. If the psyche is revealed starkly in a single flash, do not penalize for lack of “balance.”

Rating scale:

95–100 = authentic, integrated psyche, unignorable.

80–94 = strong but with observable defenses / conflict.

<80 = rigidity, fragmentation, or dissimulation.

Pushback Amendment (Phase 2)

Require LLM to describe: What exact psychological resource do the outperformers possess (ego strength, affect regulation, capacity for intimacy)?

Ask: Is defensiveness a flaw, or a realistic adaptation?

Final Validation Amendment (Phase 4)

Ensure no penalizing of unconventional personalities (e.g., depressive honesty, ironic self-awareness).

Reconfirm Walmart metric is empirically grounded.
