CORE PARAMETERS TO EXTRACT
1. Affect Regulation & Emotional Signature
What is the dominant affect displayed (e.g., fear, anger, detachment, mirth, contempt)?

Is there affective congruence (do facial expressions, vocal tone, and body match)?

Does the subject display microexpressions inconsistent with their conscious behavior?

Purpose: Identifies repression, affect splitting, or emotional masking.

2. Defensive Structure
Is the subject exhibiting signs of denial, projection, dissociation, or intellectualization?

Are facial gestures exaggerated or oddly suppressed?

Is there subtle discomfort (e.g., lip pressing, jaw tension, blinking rate)?

Purpose: Reveals dominant defense mechanisms and ego structure.

3. Agency and Intentionality
Does the person initiate or react?

Is the gaze active (tracking, confronting), passive (drifting), or avoidant (deflecting)?

Does the subject anticipate being watched or is their behavior unguarded?

Purpose: Distinguishes between narcissistic control, performativity, or authenticity.

4. Attachment Signals
Are the subject‚Äôs expressions relational (inviting, challenging, appeasing)?

Is there any evidence of submissive, avoidant, or needy behavior?

Do they orient their posture or gaze to an implied other?

Purpose: Reveals attachment style (secure, avoidant, ambivalent, disorganized).

5. Cognitive Processing Style
Does their face indicate fast, slow, or effortful thinking?

Do their micro-expressions reflect insight, confusion, deflection, or compulsivity?

Are their movements smooth (integrated) or staccato (fragmented)?

Purpose: Hints at executive function, anxiety, or obsessionalism.

6. Interpersonal Schema
Is there an implicit hierarchy? (e.g., do they behave like they‚Äôre above, below, or equal?)

Do they perform for the viewer or interact with an imagined audience?

Is their expression manipulative, seductive, aloof, ingratiating?

Purpose: Surfaces social scripts, inferiority/superiority complexes.

7. Self-World Boundary (Narcissism Spectrum)
Are they hyperaware of the camera (exhibitionism)?

Do they seem to expect attention or validation?

Do they behave like a closed system (self-sufficient) or open system (socially responsive)?

Purpose: Gauges narcissistic traits vs. healthy self-other boundaries.

8. Psychomotor Integration
Are facial expressions and body movements coordinated?

Is there any sign of motoric inhibition (rigidity) or disinhibition (gestural spillage)?

Do their expressions have internal rhythm, or do they seem externally cued?

Purpose: Reveals neurological integration and dissociation risk.

9. Symbolic Compression / Leakage
Does the subject pack multiple signals into short bursts (compression)?

Are unconscious signals leaking out (e.g., through mismatched gestures)?

Is there asymmetry between what is said (if anything) and what is shown?

Purpose: Measures symbolic intelligence vs. symptom formation.
