TEXTUAL/VERBAL (FOR TEXT) 
A. Affect in Language

B. Gaze/Attention Equivalents (in Text)

Fixated repetition of themes – circling the same idea obsessively.

Hyper-detailed observation – extreme micro-description of trivial details.

Avoidance of key topics – sidestepping obvious questions or core issues.

Paranoid attention markers – constant suspicion, references to being watched, controlled, or deceived.

Thought blocking – abrupt sentence stops, trailing ellipses.

Neologisms – invented words or bizarre new usages.

Clanging – rhyming or alliteration instead of meaning.

Word salad – incoherent combinations without semantic glue.
