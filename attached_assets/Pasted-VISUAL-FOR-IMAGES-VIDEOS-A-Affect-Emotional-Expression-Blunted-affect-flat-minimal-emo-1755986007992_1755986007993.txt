J. Global Integration & Breakdown

Affect-cognition mismatch (face doesn’t match thought content)

Fragmentation (facial/body cues pointing in different directions)

Psychotic flattening (total deadness of expression despite stimulation)


TEXTUAL/VERBAL (FOR TEXT) 
A. Affect in Language

Blunted affect in text – emotionally flat, monotonous writing (no modulation, just “is/is not”).

Inappropriate affect – jokes, eroticism, or violence in irrelevant contexts.

Labile affect – sudden shifts from calm to angry, tender to hostile.

Affective incongruity – words describing one thing but tone signals another.

Over-intensity – exaggerated emotional words out of proportion.

B. Gaze/Attention Equivalents (in Text)

Fixated repetition of themes – circling the same idea obsessively.

Hyper-detailed observation – extreme micro-description of trivial details.

Avoidance of key topics – sidestepping obvious questions or core issues.

Paranoid attention markers – constant suspicion, references to being watched, controlled, or deceived.

Disorganized focus – jumps in attention with no logical link.

C. Expression Style / Syntax

Thought blocking – abrupt sentence stops, trailing ellipses.

Neologisms – invented words or bizarre new usages.

Clanging – rhyming or alliteration instead of meaning.

Word salad – incoherent combinations without semantic glue.

Over-structured / compulsive formality – stiff, rigid, over-grammatical language.

D. Content of Speech

Delusional material – grandiose claims, bizarre beliefs stated as fact.

Ideas of reference – everything tied back to self (hidden messages, conspiracies).

Magical thinking – “If I think it, it happens” logic.

Violent ideation – fixation on blood, knives, punishment.

Erotic/perverse content – intrusive sexual themes disconnected from context.

E. Relational / Attachment Language

Dismissive-avoidant stance – cold detachment, no “I-you” reciprocity.

Fearful-avoidant – warm one moment, hostile or fearful the next.

Clinging/dependent tone – constant pleas for reassurance, repeated self-diminishment.

Hostile/paranoid projection – “they are all against me” style.

Complete relational absence – text reads as soliloquy, no audience awareness.

F. Defenses in Language

Projection in wording – “they want me dead,” “they hate me,” etc.

Isolation of affect – coldly describing traumatic/violent events with no feeling.

Intellectualization – hiding behind abstract jargon to avoid emotion.

Denial – blunt contradictions (“I am not angry” in angry prose).

Dissociation signals – text drifts into dreamlike, detached registers.

G. Cognitive Organization

Loose associations – ideas connected only by weak tangents.

Derailment – topic shifts mid-sentence with no coherence.

Tangentiality – answer related but never on point.

Perseveration – repeating the same phrase over and over.

Concrete thinking – inability to handle metaphor or abstraction.

H. Psychomotor/Behavioral Equivalents (in text)

Agitated text rhythm – lots of exclamation, capitalization, erratic punctuation.

Slowed / retarded pace – long, dragging sentences, little content.

Catatonic blankness in words – bare-bones, “I ate. I slept. I sat.”

Compulsions in text – counting, ordering, listing excessively.

Ritualistic phrasing – fixed stock phrases repeated regardless of context.

I. Global Integration

Narrative fragmentation – no beginning-middle-end, just shards.

Contradictory self-concepts – flipping identity, incompatible claims.

Over-rigidity – perfectly uniform tone, sterile prose.

Under-integration – sudden shifts in voice or perspective (like multiple speakers).

Semantic collapse – meaning drains away into abstraction or nonsense.

J. Markers of Psychotic Process

Voices in text – “They told me…,” “The voices say…”

Third-person self-reference – writing about self as “he” or “she.”

Bizarre, idiosyncratic metaphors that don’t land outside the writer’s head.

Hyper-abstract vagueness – dense fog of words, no semantic traction.

Over-determined symbolism – everything stands for something else, paranoid allegory.
