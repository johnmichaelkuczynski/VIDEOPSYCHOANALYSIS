DO NOT ELIMINATE ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY. THE FUNCTIONALITY ABOUT TO BE DESCRIBED IS ADDITIONAL TO EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY AND DOES NOT REPOLACE IT. 
I HAVE UPLOADED A DOCUMENT (THIS ONE) CONTAINING 20 COGNITIVE PARAMETERS AND 20 PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. 
YOU WILL CREATE A NEW TAB (COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE) THAT USES THESE 20 COGNITIVE PARAMETERS TO GENERATE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS; THE ANALYSIS WEIGHS IN ON EACH OF THESE PARAMETERS, AND IT PROVIDES QUOTATIONS FROM THE TEXT AS WELL AS ARGUMENTS AND CAREFUL REASONING TO SUPPORT ITS CLAIMS. EACH OF THE ‘WINDOWS’ (IE EACH OF THE BUBBLE CONTAINING WHAT THE APP SAYS ABOUT A GIVEN PARAMETER) SHOULD BE EXPANDABLE. THIS FEATURE WILL SUPPORT TYPING, COPYING/PASTING, DRAG-AND-DROP UPLOAD, AND DOCUMENT UPLOAD; THIS FOR PDF, WORD, TXT. USERS WILL BE TO DOWNLOAD THESE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS AS WORD, PDF, TXT.

BEFORE RUNNING A REPORT, THE USER SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF SUPPLYING ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT HE DEEPS RELEVANT. MOREOVER, AFTER THE REPORT IS COMPLETE, THE USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND WITH HIS OWN OPINION, AND BE ALLOWED TO DIALOGUE WITH THE APP ABOUT ANY INFORMATION THAT IT SHOULD (IN THE USER’S OPINION) TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN ANALYZING THE DOCUMENT IN QUESTION. MOREOVER, IN THE VERY SAME WINDOW/POPUP WHERE THE USE IS HAVING THIS DIALOGUE, HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN A NEW ANALYSIS (ON THE SAME DOCUMENT) THAT TAKES THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INTO ACCOUNT. THUS, RECURSIVE ANALYSIS (ENRICHED BY CHATS/ADDITIONAL DATA/ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION) IS POSSIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE AND THE COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. 


Cognitive Profiling Parameters:

1. Compression Tolerance – Degree to which the person seeks dense, abstract representations over surface details.
2. Inferential Depth – How far ahead a person naturally projects in causal/logical chains before committing to conclusions.
